# üìù Payment Flow Overview for Mobile Developers

1. **Start Payment (POST `/initiate/`)**
   - Send trip details and payment method.
   - If **cash**, you are done!
   - If **card/mobile_money/bank_transfer**, you receive a `payment_link`. Open it in a WebView or redirect the user to it.

2. **User Completes Payment on Flutterwave**
   - After payment, the user is redirected back to your app with query parameters: `tx_ref`, `transaction_id`, and `status`.

3. **Verify Payment (GET `/verify/`)**
   - Send the query parameters received from Flutterwave to `/verify/`.
   - If verified, you‚Äôll get a **success** response and can mark the trip as paid in your UI.

---

# üîê Security Notes
- Only authenticated users can initiate payments.
- The verification endpoint does **not** require authentication because it's called after Flutterwave redirects.

---

# üí≥ Supported Payment Methods
- `cash`
- `card`
- `mobile_money`
- `bank_transfer`
